Public Facelet API.  Most developers should be able to utilizing the framework using
the public classes and interfaces.
<p/>
An application that wishes to use Facelets as a ViewHandler, they must specify the
following in their <code>faces-config.xml</code> (@see com.sun.facelets.FaceletViewHandler).
<pre><code>
&lt;application>
  &lt;view-handler>com.sun.facelets.FaceletViewHandler&lt;/view-handler>
&lt;/application>
</code></pre>
<p/>
Below is sample code for using Facelets at the API level with JavaServer Faces.
<pre><code>
// get the view to render
FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
UIViewRoot viewToRender = context.getViewRoot();

// grab our FaceletFactory and create a Facelet
FaceletFactory factory = FaceletFactory.getInstance();
Facelet f = factory.getFacelet(viewToRender.getViewId());

// populate UIViewRoot
f.apply(context, viewToRender);
</code></pre>
